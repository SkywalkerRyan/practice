# Arrays

## S 3.1 Easy

    3.1.9 Find the Union, Try using two pointer
    3.1.12 Longest subarray with given sum K(positives), Try using two pointer

## S 3.2 Medium

    3.2.2 Sort an array of 0's 1's and 2's, Try using Dutch National Flag algo
    3.2.3 Majority Element (>n/2 times), Try using boyer moore's voting algorithm
    3.2.8 Next Permutation,
    3.2.10 0128 Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array, Try using set
    3.2.14 Subarray Sum Equals K, Try without brute force

## S 3.3 Hard

    Majority Element (n/3 times) Try using Bayer Moore's algorithm
    Largest subarray with 0 sum, need to understand properly
    Count number of subarrays with given xor K, comeback after bit manipulation basics
    3.3 Merge two sorted arrays without extra space, Try using two pointers
    Count Inversions, Return after sorting
    Reverse pair, Return after sorting

# Linked List

## S 6.3 Medium LL

    6.3.3 Reverse a LL [Recursive], Come back after recursion
    6.3.7 Check if LL is palindrome or not, Try by reversing the list
