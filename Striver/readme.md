# Arrays

## S 3.1 Easy

    S 3.1.9 Find the Union, Try using two pointer
    S 3.1.12 Longest subarray with given sum K(positives), Try using two pointer

## S 3.2 Medium

    S 3.2.2 Sort an array of 0's 1's and 2's, Try using Dutch National Flag algo
    S 3.2.3 Majority Element (>n/2 times), Try using boyer moore's voting algorithm
    S 3.2.8 Next Permutation,
    S 3.2.10 Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array, Try using set
    S 3.2.14 Subarray Sum Equals K, Try without brute force

## S 3.3 Hard

    S Majority Element (n/3 times) Try using Bayer Moore's algorithm
    S Largest subarray with 0 sum, need to understand properly
    S Count number of subarrays with given xor K, comeback after bit manipulation basics
    S Merge two sorted arrays without extra space, Try using two pointers
    S Count Inversions, Return after sorting
    S Reverse pair, Return after sorting

## AM 1

# Strings

## S 5.1 Easy

## S 5.2 Medium

    S 5.2.7 Sum of Beauty of all substring, How is this working?

## AM 1

    AM 1.9 Remove element

# Hash Tables

# Two pointers/ Sliding Window

# Stacks & Queues

# Linked List

## S 6.3 Medium LL

    S 6.3.3 Reverse a LL [Recursive], Come back after recursion
    S 6.3.7 Check if LL is palindrome or not, Try by reversing the list
    S 6.3.8 Segrregate odd and even nodes in LL, how?!
    S 6.3.9 Remove Nth Node From End of List, how?!
    S 6.3.11 Sort List, return after sorting basic
    S 6.3.12 Sort a LL of 0's 1's and 2's by changing links, return after sorting basic

## S 6.4 Medium DLL

## S 6.5 Hard LL
