# 3 Arrays

## 3.1 Easy

## 3.2 Medium

## 3.3 Hard

    Majority Element (n/3 times) Try using Bayer Moore's algorithm
    Largest subarray with 0 sum, need to understand properly
    Count number of subarrays with given xor K, comeback after bit manipulation basics
    Merge two sorted arrays without extra space, Try using two pointers
    Count Inversions, Return after sorting
    Reverse pair, Return after sorting

# 5 Strings

## 5.1 Easy

## 5.2 Medium

# 6 Linked List

# Stacks & Queues

# Hash Tables

# Two pointers/ Sliding Window

# Recursion/Backtracking

# Sorting

    After finishing basics return to Count Inversions and Reverse pair in 3.3

# Searching

# Bit Manipulation

    After finishing basics return to "Count number of subarrays with given xor K" in 3.3
