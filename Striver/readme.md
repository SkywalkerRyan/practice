# 3 Arrays

## 3.1 Easy

    3.1.9 Find the Union, Try using two pointer
    3.1.12 Longest subarray with given sum K(positives), Try using two pointer

## 3.2 Medium

## 3.3 Hard

    Majority Element (n/3 times) Try using Bayer Moore's algorithm
    Largest subarray with 0 sum, need to understand properly
    Count number of subarrays with given xor K, comeback after bit manipulation basics
    Merge two sorted arrays without extra space, Try using two pointers
    Count Inversions, Return after sorting
    Reverse pair, Return after sorting

# 5 Strings

## 5.1 Easy

## 5.2 Medium

    5.2.7 Sum of Beauty of all substring, How is this working?

# 6 Linked List

    6.3.3 Reverse a LL [Recursive], Come back after recursion
    6.3.7 Check if LL is palindrome or not, Try by reversing the list
    6.3.8 Segrregate odd and even nodes in LL, how?!
    6.3.9 Remove Nth Node From End of List, how?!

# Stacks & Queues

# Hash Tables

# Two pointers/ Sliding Window

# Recursion/Backtracking

    After basic return tu Reverse a LL [Recursive] in 6.3

# Sorting

    After basic return to Count Inversions and Reverse pair in 3.3

# Searching

# Bit Manipulation

    After basic return to "Count number of subarrays with given xor K" in 3.3

# Tree/BST/Trie

# Heaps

# Greedy

# Dynamic Programming

# Graphs/Union Finds
