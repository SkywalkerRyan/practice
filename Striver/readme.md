# Arrays

## S 3.1 Easy

    3.1.9 Find the Union, Try using two pointer
    3.1.12 Longest subarray with given sum K(positives), Try using two pointer

## S 3.2 Medium

    3.2.2 Sort an array of 0's 1's and 2's, Try using Dutch National Flag algo
    3.2.3 Majority Element (>n/2 times), Try using boyer moore's voting algorithm
    3.2.8 Next Permutation,
    3.2.10 0128 Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array, Try using set
    3.2.14 Subarray Sum Equals K, Try without brute force

## S 3.3 Hard

    Majority Element (n/3 times) Try using Bayer Moore's algorithm
    Largest subarray with 0 sum, need to understand properly
    Count number of subarrays with given xor K, comeback after bit manipulation basics
    3.3 Merge two sorted arrays without extra space, Try using two pointers
    Count Inversions, Return after sorting
    Reverse pair, Return after sorting

## AM 1

    1.10 Merge two sorted arrays without extra space, Try using two pointers
    1.15 H Index, What the fuck is it even asking?!

# Strings

## S 5.1 Easy

## S 5.2 Medium

    5.2.7 Sum of Beauty of all substring, How is this working?

## AM 1

    1.9 Remove element

# Hash Tables

## AM 2

    2.10 0128 Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array, Try using set

# Two pointers/ Sliding Window

## AM 3

    3.7 0016 3Sum Closest
    3.9 0042 Trapping rain water, How the f?!

# Stacks & Queues

## S 9.2 Prefix, Infix, Postfix

    Come back later. Skipping for now.

# Linked List

## S 6.3 Medium LL

    6.3.3 Reverse a LL [Recursive], Come back after recursion
    6.3.7 Check if LL is palindrome or not, Try by reversing the list
    6.3.8 Segrregate odd and even nodes in LL, how?!
    6.3.9 Remove Nth Node From End of List, how?!
    6.3.11 Sort List, return after sorting basic
    6.3.12 Sort a LL of 0's 1's and 2's by changing links, return after sorting basic

## S 6.4 Medium DLL

## S 6.5 Hard LL

# Binary Search

# Recursion/Backtracking

    S After basic return to Reverse a LL [Recursive] in 6.3.3

# Sorting

    S After basic return to Count Inversions and Reverse pair in 3.3
    S After basic return to Sort list in 6.3.11
    S After basic return to Sort a LL of 0's 1's and 2's by changing links 6.3.12

# Searching

# Bit Manipulation

    S After basic return to "Count number of subarrays with given xor K" in 3.3

# Tree/BST/Trie

# Heaps

# Greedy

# Dynamic Programming

# Graphs/Union Finds
