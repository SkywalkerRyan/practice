# Arrays

## Easy

## Medium

## Hard

    Majority Element (n/3 times) Try using Bayer Moore's algorithm
    Largest subarray with 0 sum, need to understand properly
    Count number of subarrays with given xor K, comeback after bit manipulation basics

# Strings

# Linked List

# Stacks & Queues

# Hash Tables

# Two pointers/ Sliding Window

# Recursion/Backtracking

# Sorting

# Searching

# Bit Manipulation

    After finishing basics return to "Count number of subarrays with given xor K" in

# Tree/BST/Trie

# Heaps

# Greedy

# Dynamic Programming

# Graphs/Union Finds
